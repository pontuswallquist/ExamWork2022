With inital rewards system

model_1 80% 
Trained for 250 games
Learning rate: 0.001
Epsilon decay: 0.95
Gamma: 0.95

model_2 63 %
Trained for 250 games
Learning rate: 0.0005
Epsilon decay: 0.95
Gamma: 0.95

With potential Score added after every bid as reward, with penalty reward *= (7-value) / 6
Better action taking with this but value 1 is played too often
